# Timeseries_Forecasting

## Overview

Generally, emission of carbon dioxide from living animals, humans, wetlands, volcanoes, and other sources is nearly balanced by the same amount being removed from the atmosphere by plant photosynthesis and by the oceans. Human activity is disturbing this equilibrium by generating increased CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels like as coal, gas, and petroleum products; and combustion via electricity generation, transportation, industry, and domestic use. The results of these imbalances are believed to be greenhouse effects: global warming, melting of polar ice sheets and caps, a rise in sea levels and subsequent coastal inundations, and damage to agriculture and natural ecosystems, among others. 

In this project, time series data on carbon dioxide emissions in North America will be considered for the period 1990 to 2015. The time series data will be analyzed with the help of various ARIMA models to generate forecasts using an appropriate model.
